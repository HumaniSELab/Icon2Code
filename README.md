# Icon2Code

We present a prototype tool, Icon2Code, targeted to help app developers more quickly implement the callback functions of complex Android GUI components by recommending code implementations learned from similar GUI components from other apps. Given an icon or UI widget provided by designers, Icon2Code first queries a large pre-established database to locate similar icons that other apps have utilized.
